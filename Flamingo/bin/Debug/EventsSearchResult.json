Throughout the year, Packer creates new improvisational work in support of a research and performance project entitled Call and Response. Each program in Call and Response involves a new collaborator and builds a new conversation between elements of color, light, ephemeral form, movement, sound and site. In Call and Response: ECHOLOCATION, Packer collaborates with Alex Nathanson and Dylan Neely of Fan Letters in a nonlinear feedback loop of analog/digital chain reactions. Humans and machines interpret, amplify, and reposition one anothers moves as image and sound ricochet throughout ISSUEs 22 Boerum space. Packer and Fan Letters sculpt sound with light, and shape light with sound, creating space for absurdity, rogue behavior, surprises, and moments of reassuring knowns. Photovoltaic electromechanical audio synthesis builds the soundtrack for cinema that is not a film but is a motion picture. Improvisational percussive machines play catch with sound and light waves. Rhythmic structures riff on form and function, rendering visible the invisible and redirecting expectations around cause and effect. A laboratory of ad hoc discovery, ECHOLOCATION is the buzzing light beam escaping from the far side of a black hole, reshaped and reconfigured by its journey and not able to say exactly where its been. ECHOLOCATION is a visual score for a microscope aimed at a telescope attached to an ear-horn with headphones on. It is parallel play that sometimes crosses wires, resisting technological ease and foregrounding the impractical, anti-intuitive nature of creative process. Echolocation determines spatial relationships through precise sensing and interpretation of reflected sound waves. ECHOLOCATION gets in its own way as effectively as possible at all times, casting its own shadows to establish where we are now -- so that we can take the next step. Lindsay Packer plays with the call and response of color and light, form and site in photography, film and video, installations, and improvisational performance. With a spontaneous spirit and non-hierarchical approach to materials and process, she creates immersive environments that are integral to and inseparable from their architectural and sonic contexts. Her work connects the visual language of painting to the kineticism of early cinema while allowing site, movement, chance, and improvisation to inform color and composition. Packer collaborated with choreographer Melanie Maar for her first 2019 commission at ISSUE in Call and Response: DEPTH OF FIELD and with Anaïs Maviel for her second ISSUE commission in Call and Response: TRANSPOSITION. She is a 2019 NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellow in Architecture/Environmental Structures/Design, was a Fulbright Fellow to India in Installation Art and a two-time Artist-in-Residence at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation. Her short film Motion at a Distance (with sound by Andrew Yong Hoon Lee) is an official selection of the upcoming New Orleans Film Festival and the Eyeworks Festival of Experimental Animation and is supported by a 2019 Media Arts Assistance Fund (MAAF) Distribution/Exhibition Support Grant from New York State Council on the Arts in Partnership with Wave Farm. Packer received a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She lives and works in Brooklyn. Fan Letters is a multimedia collaboration between artist Alex Nathanson and musician Dylan Neely. Their work combines sound, video, and handmade electromechanical objects in playful, interactive performances. Shows oscillate between noise and chamber music, from experimental cinema to Saturday morning cartoons, and political negotiations to schoolyard games. Fan Letters has performed throughout North America and Europe and has been awarded multiple residencies at The Watermill Center. Alex Nathanson is a multimedia artist, engineer, and educator exploring practical and experimental applications of sustainable energy technologies. His artwork has been featured at the Museum of the Moving Image, Film Society of Lincoln Center, Anthology Film Archives, PS122 Gallery, Dome of Visions (Copenhagen, Denmark), and the Art Prospect Festival (St. Petersburg, Russia), among other venues. He has a M.S. in Integrated Digital Media from NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Composer and musician Dylan Neely has performed at The Museum of the Moving Image, Issue Project Room, Symphony Space, Lincoln Center, The Stone, MoMA PS1, and La MaMa, among other venues and has written music for theater & opera projects presented at The Drawing Center, The Tank, Columbia University, and The Watermill Center. He received a from B.A. Bard College at Simons Rock and an M.F.A. from Mills College with additional studies at Juilliard and at the Belgrade Faculty of Music on a Fulbright Fellowship.","category":"concerts","labels":["concert","music"],"rank":28,"local_rank":30,"entities":[{"type":"venue","formatted_address":"22 Boerum Place\nNY 11201\nUnited States of America","name":"ISSUE Project Room","entity_id":"K89gtVU9RE9m4ZqTRc22BC"}],"duration":7200,"start":"2019-12-13T01:00:00Z","end":"2019-12-13T03:00:00Z","updated":"2019-10-18T04:28:25Z","first_seen":"2019-10-18T04:28:16Z","timezone":"America/New_York","location":[-73.989722,40.690847],"scope":"locality","country":"US","place_hierarchies":[["6295630","6255149","6252001","5128638","6941775","6332516"],["6295630","6255149","6252001","5128638","5128581"]],"state":"active"},{"relevance":null,"id":"mo3QoraXdSrMGqWXoG","title":"Elf the Musical","description":"A title known the world over, “Elf the Musical” is a must-produce holiday musical that can easily become an annual tradition for any theatre.

The commemoration will culminate in a celebratory end-of-season concert featuring Havana’s greatest composers and the golden era of Cuban music. Through illustrated formal presentations and archival films, the conference will not only highlight Havana’s fundamental role in the cultural development of Cuba, but will also explore the different outside influences that have shaped the city across the centuries since its emergence as a key port in international cross-Atlantic trade in the 16th century. Other topics will include: a journey to 19th century Havana, including its cartography, slave society, and mores; outstanding habaneras, defining the pioneering role played by the women of Havana since colonial times; Havana’s historical link to New York City; an illustrated presentation on Havana’s architecture since its founding, including its neoclassical period, the art deco trend in the early decades of the Republic, and the construction boom and expanding modernity in the 40’s and 50’s; Havana’s legacy as an international artistic, musical, and literary beacon; the city as protagonist in literature, photography and cinema; today’s conservationist movement and its UNESCO Heritage Sites; and much more… The conference will be dedicated to Cuban poet and writer José Lezama Lima. Invited participants include PBS award-winning journalist Rafael Pi Román, distinguished Harvard professor and keynote speaker Alejandro de la Fuente, scholars Ana María Hernández and Adriana Méndez Rodenas, architects Raúl Rodríguez and Hermes Mallea, poet and essayist Lourdes Gil, sociologist Lisandro Pérez, literary critics Elena Palmero and Perla Rozencvaig, filmmakers Jorge Dalton and Florian Borchmeyer, historians José Moya and Rosa Leonor Whitmarsh, musicians and composers Paquito D’Rivera and Carlos Varela, conservationist Gustavo Araoz, president of the International Council of Monuments and Sites, and other luminaries from the U.S., Cuba, Europe, and Latin America.
