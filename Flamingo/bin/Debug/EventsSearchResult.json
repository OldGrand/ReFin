Behind the Scenes at Belkin Concerts\n\nCleveland rock fans know all about what was happening on the concert stage. What was going on backstage was an entirely different story. Fran & Jules Belkin share the stories you never heard and the swag you never saw, artfully woven together with vintage snapshots, concert photography and intimate memories illustrating the incredible story of a most unusual family business: Belkin Productions.\nRock This Town! is for those of us who were out front, standing drenched in a World Series of Rock downpour, singing along to every word of our favorite song, Bic lighters in the air, screaming for another encore. This is a love letter to every fan of rock and roll.\nRock photographer Janet Macoska calls this book “one of the only memory albums ever made that gives an inside glimpse at concert production and promotion.”\n“If you live and breathe music like I do, you’re about to be transported back to that magical time with every turn of the page.” —Barry Gabel, SVP Live Nation\n\n\n\n\nFran Belkin Bio\n\nFran Belkin grew up in Los Angeles and attended UCLA. She moved to Cleveland for love—and fell in love with Cleveland along the way. In the mid ’60s, her husband Jules was a pioneer in the rock and roll music industry. Fran worked along side him as Belkin Productions grew to become one of the largest regional concert promoters and quietly, one of the most influential in the nation. At the same time, Fran nurtured her passion for art and creative projects. Her 10’ mosaic Fender guitar appeared on the cover of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s first Guitarmania catalog, and she has studied at Anderson Ranch in Colorado.\nFor over a decade, she’s served on the Cleveland Institute of Art’s Board of Directors, Fran produced Tripped Up, a 2018 feature-length documentary film chronicling Competitours, her son’s 11-day travel competition, (in which she’s participated five times). The film premiered at Cleveland International Film Festival and is currently on the film festival circuit. Rock This Town! is her first book.\n\nJules Belkin Bio\n\nJules Belkin’s importance to Cleveland’s rise as a destination for musicians of all genres is evidenced by the thousands of concert tickets bearing his family’s name now stowed away in old cigar boxes.\nIt’s been more than half a century since he and his brother, Mike, produced the first Belkin Production — a double bill featuring The Four Freshmen and The New Christy Minstrels. They sold their operation to Live Nation in 2001, but even today, many artists’ appreciation for Cleveland is due largely to having worked with the Belkins.\nStill, even while discussing the business, Jules is very matter-of-fact about it all. The brothers sort of stumbled into the business while working for their family’s clothing store and doing some booking on the side. “When we started the business, it was relatively new. There were no guidelines,” said Jules Belkin, who handled the marketing and production aspects while Mike handed most of the bookings. “There were no examples to go from. Nothing out there. Everything out there was being improvised on both sides of the concert stage — performer and promoter. Everything was by the seat of your pants.”\n\nThe goal of the Cleveland Stories Dinner Party is to bring to life some of the fun, interesting stories about Cleveland’s past – from sports, to rock ‘n roll, to Millionaire’s Row, — the series will focus on tidbits from Cleveland’s past that will really thrill the audience.
