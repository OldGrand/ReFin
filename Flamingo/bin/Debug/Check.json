Boasting both jazz and modernist credentials, Ammann writes music of great spontaneity and verve. Debussy’s three-movement La Mer—which was given its American premiere by the BSO in 1907—is among the greatest of all French orchestral works, a musical depiction of the changing states of the sea over the course of a day. The program also includes two shorter works: Fauré’s stately, gorgeous, and familiar Pavane, as well as the third movement of Olivier Messiaen’s early orchestral work L’Ascension (1932), which already demonstrates the composer’s unique voice as well as his Debussy-influenced musical heritage.","category":"performing-arts","labels":["performing-arts"],"rank":58,"local_rank":64,"entities":[{"formatted_address":"301 Massachusetts Avenue\nBoston, MA 02115\nUnited States of America","entity_id":"iUY38fE3LPYGsTbhcq2Nym","type":"venue","name":"Boston Symphony Orchestra"}],"duration":0,"start":"2019-10-25T17:30:00Z","end":"2019-10-25T17:30:00Z","updated":"2019-04-05T11:15:02Z","first_seen":"2019-04-05T11:12:29Z","timezone":"America\/New_York","location":[-71.085685,42.342917],"scope":"locality","country":"US","place_hierarchies":[["6295630","6255149","6252001","6254926","4952349","4930956"],["6295630","6255149","6252001","6254926","4952349","4929532"]],"state":"active"},{"relevance":null,"id":"dYb8YGaqGuYmEo7sHJ","title":"Hamilton","description":"HAMILTON is the story of America’s Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington’s right-hand man during the Revolutionary War and was the new nation’s first Treasury Secretary.

Napua Greig is a Kumu Hula, school teacher, recording artist, and mother of three. She began her solo recording career with the release of “Pihana” in 2007. In 2010, she released her sophomore album, “Mohalu,” which received three Na Hoku Hanohano awards. Her self-revealing and most recent release, “Makawalu” (2017), is sure to garner Napua more awards. Singer, songwriter Amy Hanaialii remains Hawaii’s top selling female vocalist of all time and her success as a recording artist is evidenced by a multitude of Grammy and Na Hoku Hanohano nominations, awards and acknowledgements. She remains a dedicated promoter of Hawaiian culture in a commitment that stems from her family’s heritage and strongly rooted ancestral responsibility. Raiatea Helm made history in 2006 as Hawaii’s first solo female vocalist ever to receive a Grammy nomination for her sophomore CD “Sweet and Lovely.” She is also a Grammy Award-nominee and multiple Na Hoku award- winner. Though Hawaiian music will be her first love musically, she has successfully branched out with jazz recordings and performances expanding her diverse repertoire. Tickets: $45-$65.","category":"concerts","labels":["concert","music"],"rank":53,"local_rank":63,"entities":[{"formatted_address":"1130 Bethel Street\nHonolulu, HI 96813\nUnited States of America","entity_id":"AYXpURfWdthZEKHjXFrwKB","type":"venue","name":"Hawaii Theatre"}],"duration":0,"start":"2019-10-26T05:30:00Z","end":"2019-10-26T05:30:00Z","updated":"2019-09-10T03:31:57Z","first_seen":"2019-09-10T03:31:51Z","timezone":"Pacific\/Honolulu","location":[-157.861235,21.310976],"scope":"locality","country":"US","place_hierarchies":[["6295630","6255149","6252001","5855797","5856194","5856195"],["6295630","6255149","6252001","5855797","5856194","5857285"]],"state":"active"}]}
